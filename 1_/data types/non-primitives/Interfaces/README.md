## Interfaces

Implementing an interface allows a class to become more formal about the behavior it promises to provide. 

Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world, 
and this contract is enforced at build time by the compiler. 

If your class claims to implement an interface, 
all methods defined by that interface must appear in its source code
 before the class will successfully compile.
